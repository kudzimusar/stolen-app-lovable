## 🛡️ **Coherence Rules Framework**

### **RULE 1: Mission Alignment Rule**
> **Every feature must directly serve the device recovery mission or support stakeholder functionality**

**Validation Questions:**
- Does this feature help recover stolen devices?
- Does this feature support marketplace transactions?
- Does this feature serve one of the 8 stakeholder types?
- Does this feature enhance community engagement?

**Violation Examples:**
- ❌ Adding social media features unrelated to device recovery
- ❌ Implementing international payment systems (not South African focus)
- ❌ Creating features that don't serve any stakeholder

### **RULE 2: Stakeholder Equality Rule**
> **All 8 stakeholder types must receive equal attention and functionality**

**Validation Questions:**
- Does this feature serve all relevant stakeholder types?
- Are we maintaining balance across stakeholder priorities?
- Does this change affect stakeholder coverage?
- Are we preserving stakeholder-specific workflows?

**Violation Examples:**
- ❌ Prioritizing one stakeholder type over others
- ❌ Removing functionality from any stakeholder type
- ❌ Creating features that exclude certain stakeholders

### **RULE 3: Technical Consistency Rule**
> **All technical decisions must maintain consistency with the established tech stack**

**Validation Questions:**
- Does this use our established technology stack?
- Is this consistent with our API patterns?
- Does this maintain our performance standards?
- Is this compatible with our database schema?

**Violation Examples:**
- ❌ Adding new frameworks without updating tech documentation
- ❌ Creating inconsistent API patterns
- ❌ Breaking established database relationships

### **RULE 4: South African Focus Rule**
> **All features must be optimized for the South African market**

**Validation Questions:**
- Does this support ZAR currency?
- Is this compliant with FICA regulations?
- Does this work with South African banking systems?
- Is this optimized for South African user behavior?

**Violation Examples:**
- ❌ Adding USD/EUR currency support without ZAR focus
- ❌ Implementing features that don't comply with FICA
- ❌ Creating workflows that don't work with SA banks

### **RULE 5: S-Pay Integration Rule**
> **All financial features must integrate with the S-Pay wallet system**

**Validation Questions:**
- Does this integrate with S-Pay wallet?
- Is this consistent with S-Pay transaction patterns?
- Does this maintain escrow protection?
- Is this compatible with S-Pay security standards?

**Violation Examples:**
- ❌ Creating payment features outside S-Pay
